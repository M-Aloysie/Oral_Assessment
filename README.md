## Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **LinkedList Manipulation**: A TypeScript implementation of a singly linked list with methods for adding, removing, and finding elements.
2. **Temperature Converter**: A React class component, written in TypeScript, that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

These tasks demonstrate a strong understanding of class-based data structures, node manipulation, state, and props handling in React.

## Core Features

### LinkedList Manipulation

- **Add Node**  
  Add a new node to the linked list.
  
- **Remove Node**  
  Remove a node by its value from the linked list.
  
- **Find Node**  
  Search for a node by its value in the linked list.

### Temperature Converter

- **Temperature Conversion**  
  Allows users to input a temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and convert it to the other unit.
  
- **State Handling**  
  Uses React class components to manage state and handle user input.
  
- **Live Updates**  
  Automatically updates the converted temperature as users enter values.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe implementation of LinkedList and React components.
- **React**: Utilized for building the temperature converter interface.
- **Node.js**: Used as the runtime environment for TypeScript.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- TypeScript (for LinkedList compilation)
- React (for the Temperature Converter)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Aloysie/oral-assessment-linkedlist-tempconverter.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd oral-assessment-linkedlist-tempconverter
```

3. Install dependencies for React
```bash
npm install
```

4. Install dependencies for TypeScript
```bash
cd temperature-converter
npm install
```

4. Compile the TypeScript file for LinkedList
```bash
tsc LinkedList.ts
```
